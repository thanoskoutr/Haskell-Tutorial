# Haskell-Tutorial
This repository contains the majority of examples in Haskell from the book "Learn You a Haskell for Great Good", by Miran Lipovaƒça. You can find it [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/).

# Structure
Every haskell file has functions and examples from the chapter of the book based on the name
of the file.
Here is a list that shows the connection between the files and the book chapters:

2. Starting Out &#8594; `functions.hs`, `lists.hs`
3. Types and Typeclasses &#8594; `types.hs`
4. Syntax in Functions &#8594; `functions.hs`
5. Recursion &#8594; `recursion.hs`
6. Higher Order Functions &#8594; `higherOrderFunctions.hs`
7. Modules &#8594; `modules.hs` (`Geometry.hs` and `Cube.hs`, `Cuboid.hs`, `Sphere.hs`)
8. Making Our Own Types and Typeclasses &#8594; `ourOwnTypes.hs`
